  "Description": "This check ensures that the 'cluster-admin' role, which provides wide-ranging powers, is used only where necessary. The 'cluster-admin' role grants super-user access to perform any action on any resource, including all namespaces. It should be applied cautiously to avoid excessive privileges.",
  "Risk": "Inappropriate use of the 'cluster-admin' role can lead to excessive privileges, increasing the risk of malicious actions and potentially impacting the cluster's security posture.",

  "Remediation": {
    "Code": {
      "CLI": "Review and, if necessary, modify the ClusterRoleBindings to limit the use of 'cluster-admin'. Use 'kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]' to remove unnecessary bindings.",

    "Recommendation": {
      "Text": "Audit and assess the use of 'cluster-admin' role in all ClusterRoleBindings. Ensure it is assigned only to subjects that require such extensive privileges. Consider using more restrictive roles wherever possible.",
