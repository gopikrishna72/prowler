  "Description": "This check ensures that access to secrets in the Kubernetes API is restricted to the smallest possible group of users. Minimizing access to secrets helps in reducing the risk of privilege escalation and potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
  "Risk": "Inappropriate access to secrets can lead to escalation of privileges and unauthorized access to cluster resources or external resources managed through the secrets.",

  "Remediation": {
    "Code": {
