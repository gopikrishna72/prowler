# Dashboard
Prowler allows you to run your own local dashboards using the csv outputs provided by Prowler

```sh
prowler dashboard
```
The banner and additional info about the dashboard will be shown on your console:
<img src="./img/dashboard/dashboard-banner.png">

## Outputs Support

Prowler will use the outputs from the folder `/output` (for common prowler outputs) and `/output/compliance` (for prowler compliance outputs)
