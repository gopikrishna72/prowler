## Quick Start
### Installation

Prowler is available as a project in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/prowler-cloud/), thus can be installed using pip with Python >= 3.9:
```bash
pip install prowler-cloud
prowler -v
```

## Prowler container versions

The available versions of Prowler are the following:

- `latest`: in sync with master branch (bear in mind that it is not a stable version)
- `<x.y.z>` (release): you can find the releases [here](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/releases), those are stable releases.
- `stable`: this tag always point to the latest release.

The container images are available here:

- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/toniblyx/prowler/tags)
- [AWS Public ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/o4g1s5r6/prowler)

## High level architecture

You can run Prowler from your workstation, an EC2 instance, Fargate or any other container, Codebuild, CloudShell, Cloud9 and many more.

![Architecture](img/architecture.png)
## Basic Usage

To run Prowler, you will need to specify the provider (e.g aws or azure):
> If no provider specified, AWS will be used for backward compatibility with most of v2 options.

```console
prowler <provider>
```
![Prowler Execution](img/short-display.png)
> Running the `prowler` command without options will use your environment variable credentials, see [Requirements](getting-started/requirements/) section to review the credentials settings.

If you miss the former output you can use `--verbose` but Prowler v3 is smoking fast so you won't see much ;)

By default, Prowler will generate a CSV, JSON and HTML reports, however you can generate a JSON-ASFF (used by AWS Security Hub) report with `-M` or `--output-modes`:

```console
prowler <provider> -M csv json json-asff html
```
The html report will be located in the output directory as the other files and it will look like:

![Prowler Execution](img/html-output.png)

You can use `-l`/`--list-checks` or `--list-services` to list all available checks or services within the provider.

```console
prowler <provider> --list-checks
prowler <provider> --list-services
```

For executing specific checks or services you can use options `-c`/`checks` or `-s`/`services`:

```console
prowler azure --checks storage_blob_public_access_level_is_disabled
prowler aws --services s3 ec2
```

Also, checks and services can be excluded with options `-e`/`--excluded-checks` or `--excluded-services`:

```console
prowler aws --excluded-checks s3_bucket_public_access
prowler azure --excluded-services defender iam
```

More options and executions methods that will save your time in [Miscelaneous](tutorials/misc.md).

You can always use `-h`/`--help` to access to the usage information and all the possible options:

```console
prowler --help
```

### AWS

Use a custom AWS profile with `-p`/`--profile` and/or AWS regions which you want to audit with `-f`/`--filter-region`:

```console
prowler aws --profile custom-profile -f us-east-1 eu-south-2
```
> By default, `prowler` will scan all AWS regions.

### Azure

With Azure you need to specify which auth method is going to be used:

```console
# To use service principal authentication
prowler azure --sp-env-auth

# To use az cli authentication
prowler azure --az-cli-auth

# To use browser authentication
prowler azure --browser-auth

# To use managed identity auth
prowler azure --managed-identity-auth
```

More details in [Requirements](getting-started/requirements.md)

Prowler by default scans all the subscriptions that is allowed to scan, if you want to scan a single subscription or various concrete subscriptions you can use the following flag (using az cli auth as example):
```console
prowler azure --az-cli-auth --subscription-ids <subscription ID 1> <subscription ID 2> ... <subscription ID N>
```
