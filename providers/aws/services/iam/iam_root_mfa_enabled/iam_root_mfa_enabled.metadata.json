  "Risk": "The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled when a user signs in to an AWS website they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device. When virtual MFA is used for root accounts it is recommended that the device used is NOT a personal device but rather a dedicated mobile device (tablet or phone) that is managed to be kept charged and secured independent of any individual personal devices. (non-personal virtual MFA) This lessens the risks of losing access to the MFA due to device loss / trade-in or if the individual owning the device is no longer employed at the company.",
